# AITRCS_Multimodal_Replication_Study
Finding out a lot of AI medical research may inherently be irreproducible. 

We share the following report and Google Colab notebook. Please note that while we can't share the data without permission from the physionet folks, the code should be tested and it should work with those datasets when users get access to them. Please see [here](https://physionet.org/) for more information on physionet.

Colab notebook is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Qh5T-zQnj8a5Ho7c_kdwyQpoE-q6gOOI?usp=sharing) and should contain the steps needed to reproduce our work. However, reproducing the full original repository [here](https://github.com/AITRICS/Medical_Tri_Modal_Pilot) can be very challenging as one will see in the notebook.
